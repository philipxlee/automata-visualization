      A cell can be empty, occupied by a tree, or burning. There are four rules:
      A burning cell turns into an empty cell
      A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning
      A tree ignites with probability f even if no neighbor is burning
      An empty space fills with a tree with probability p
