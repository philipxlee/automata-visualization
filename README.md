### Running the Program

 * Main class: `Main.java`

 * Data files needed: `data/[variations_folders]`

 * Interesting data files: 

 * Key/Mouse inputs: 
   * Press `n` to open up another simulation.
   * Press `next` on the screen to view the next generation of cellular automata.
   * Press `back` on the screen to view the previous generation of cellular automata.
   * Press `play` on the screen to indefinitely run the simulation.
   * Press `pause` on the screen to stop the simulation.
   * Press `toggle graph` on the screen to view the graph of the simulation showing data on the 
     simulation.
   * Press `toggle outline` on the screen to toggle the outline of the cells in the simulation.
   * Press `cell shape` on the screen to toggle the cell shape of the cells in the simulation.
   * Press `save` to save the current state of the cellular automata.
   * Drag the `simulation speed` slider to increase or decrease the ticks of the simulation.
